        <div class="body text"><p>I manage a separate VirtualBox image for every project I do. What are the benefits of doing<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>so?</p>
<h2 id="why-virtualize-">Why Virtualize?</h2>
<p><strong>Avoid dependency hell.</strong> Ever come back to a project 2-3 months later, and not be able to run it because you&#39;ve already upgraded your libraries to new versions? Debugging these scenarios always take a lot of trial and error. This won&#39;t happen anymore if you freeze the entire development environment along with the project<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>code.</p>
<p><strong>Write once, run everywhere</strong> VirtualBox images are extremely portable. VirtualBox can run on every major operating system, which means you can concievably work anywhere. If you develop on a Windows machine and want to collaborate with someone on <span class="caps">OS</span> X, you may run into problems with versioning. If both of you run VirtualBox, the problems all<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>disappear. </p>
<p><strong>No more debugging development environments for your developers.</strong> Related to the point above. Have someone joining your project? Instead of handing them a lengthy and error-prone installation guide, just give them a copy of your VirtualBox image. This saves a ridiculous amount of time and gets them up to speed with zero issues. This benefit of VirtualBox goes up the more contributers you have on your<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>project.</p>
<p><strong>Ubuntu is closer to a production environment.</strong> While not exactly the same, a Ubuntu minimal install is much closer to your production server than either Windows or <span class="caps">OS</span> X. You&#39;ll be able to solve <span class="caps">OS</span>-specific issues early, so your live deployment will be certain to go without a<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>hitch.</p>
<h2 id="preconceived-doubts">Preconceived Doubts</h2>
<p><strong>Isn&#39;t system performance severely degraded with virtualization?</strong> This really depends on what you&#39;re working on. For standard web development and design tasks, a virtualized Ubuntu is more than enough power. I&#39;m running this on a 13&quot; MacBook Air with 1.86 GHz Core 2 Duo, and I&#39;ve never had a problem with performance. Compiling might be a bit slower than you&#39;re used<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>to.</p>
<p><strong>But it&#39;s such a waste of hard drive space!</strong> Disk space is cheap these days.  My laptop has a 120 <span class="caps">GB</span> <span class="caps">HD</span>. That&#39;s probably less storage space than most of you are running. Also, installing with the Ubuntu Minimal <span class="caps">CD</span> image means you only install only the basic building blocks of the <span class="caps">OS</span>, and download what you need through apt-get. My freshly installed images weigh in 1.5 GBs each. Not bad,<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>right?</p>
<p><strong>Doesn&#39;t it take a long time to setup your dev environment over and over?</strong> Okay, you&#39;ve got me there. The actual process of installing Ubuntu doesn&#39;t take very long, but getting the right packages and plugins can take a little while. Of course, most of this time is either downloading or compiling, so you&#39;re not actually stuck at the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>computer.</p>
<p><strong>Doesn&#39;t this take a lot of system memory?</strong> This is a valid point. If you have under 2 GBs of <span class="caps">RAM</span>, performance will definitely be severely degraded with the disc swaps happening every transaction. I&#39;ve never done virtualization with anything less than 4 GBs, but&#8211;then again, my Ubuntu images run just fine with 512mb of allotted <span class="caps">RAM</span> each. I have two images running at any one time, along with Chrome and Photoshop, and performance has been<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>fine.</p>
<h2 id="the-barebones-how-to">The Barebones How-To</h2>
<p>Interested in setting up a virtual image? Download these<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>first:</p>
<ul>
<li>Latest version of <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">VirtualBox</a></li>
<li><a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD">Ubuntu 10.10 64-bit Minimal <span class="caps">CD</span></a><span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>(15.<span class="caps">6MB</span>)</li>
<li>An <span class="caps">FTP</span> program&#8211;I recommend <a href="http://panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a> for <span class="caps">OS</span> X, <a href="http://filezilla-project.org/">FileZilla</a><span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>otherwise</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Install VirtualBox.</strong> Create a new virtual machine with the default settings for a Ubuntu 64-bit guest <span class="caps">OS</span>. 512 <span class="caps">MB</span> of ram and 8 GBs of disk space is usually enough. If you have hard drive space to spare, I suggest increasing it to 20 <span class="caps">GB</span>. It&#39;s possible to increase the virtual disk size later, but it&#39;s a pain in the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>ass.</p>
<p><strong>Select your new virtual disk and open &quot;Settings.&quot;</strong> With the Settings window open, click the Network button, and select the Adapter 2 tab. Enable the adapter and choose &#39;Host-only Adapter&#39; from the dropdown menu. This is the first step in giving your host <span class="caps">OS</span> access to<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>Ubuntu.</p>
<p><strong>Boot up the new virtual disk.</strong> Select the Ubunut Minimal <span class="caps">CD</span> .iso you downloaded earlier. Ubuntu is straightfoward to install. When it&#39;s done, login with your new username and password. The first command you should run is <code>sudo apt-get install openssh-server</code>. This will allow <span class="caps">SSH</span> and <span class="caps">SFTP</span> connections from your host <span class="caps">OS</span> to the new<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>guest.</p>
<p><strong>Using either vi or nano, open</strong> <code>sudo vi /etc/network/interfaces</code>. Add the following lines to the bottom of the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>file:</p>
<pre><code>auto eth1
iface eth1 inet static
  address 192.168.56.101
  netmask 255.255.255.0
</code></pre><p>Save and exit. Run these commands in the<span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>console:</p>
<pre><code>sudo /etc.d/init/networking restart
sudo ifdown eth1
sudo ifup eth1
</code></pre><p>You&#39;re done. At this point, you should be able to <span class="caps">SSH</span> into your new virtual machine from the host <span class="caps">OS</span>, or mount the virtual drive with your <span class="caps">FTP</span><span class="widont">&nbsp;</span>program.</p>
