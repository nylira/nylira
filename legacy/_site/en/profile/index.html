  <h1>Profile</h1>

  <section class='markdown'>
    <p>As a developer, you're an incredibly creative individual.</p>

<p><aside>
  <h2>Not a developer?</h2>
  <p>No worries. I can build you a jaw-dropping site for your online store, erotic photography, or what have you, and you won't have to touch a piece of code. If you're interested, <a href='//nylira.com/en/contact'>get in touch.</a>
</aside></p>

<p>Turning lines of code into living, breathing applications take an immense amount of mental acuity. So much, perhaps, that your visual design abilities have been neglected. That's why you're here.</p>

<p>My name is Peng Zhong, and I am an interface designer who speaks your language. I believe that CSS and HTML should be provided by the designer. If designers care so much about pixel perfection, they should be writing code. Furthermore, with a better understanding of the limitations of CSS, they'll be able to bend it to their will. There's no need for you to waste your time slicing PSDs. I hate it too.</p>

<p>Are you looking for someone who cares as much about pixels as you do about code?</p>

<h2>Say hello to your match.</h2>

<p><aside>
  <h2>My Tools</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>HTML5 &amp; CSS3
  <li>Javascript
  <li>Git/Github
  <li>Skype/IRC/IM
  <li>ssh/vim/screen
  </ul>
</aside></p>

<p>I'm a visual designer who codes in vi. All my projects are sandboxed into Ubuntu Virtualbox images, which I access through SSH. I design entire sites using only the OS X Terminal (seriously, this website was built using that exact method).</p>

<p>These days, I mostly use Photoshop as a glorified color picker.</p>

<p>Whenever possible, I try to avoid writing plain CSS. In a verbose and rendundant-by-design language like CSS, anything that reduces the number of keystrokes required increases productivity. I've taken a liking to <a href="http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/">Stylus</a>, an industrial-strength CSS preprocessor. Stylus's powerful mixins and variables allow me to design more with less code, not to mention help stave off the onset of RSI.</p>

<p>At this point, you may be worried about the maintainability of Stylus. I understand you perfectly. As of 2011-06-01, Stylus is still unpopular outside the node.js community. That said, Stylus is intuitive and fast to pick up for anyone experienced with CSS. If you'd prefer to work with Sass, that's fine too. I'm comfortable both Sass and Stylus, and both languages compile down to clean CSS3.</p>

<h2>The creative process</h2>

<ul class='process'>
  <li><p>1. Research
  <li><p>2. Draw wireframes
  <li><p>3. Make protoypes
  <li><p>4. Test
  <li><p>5. Launch
  <li><p>6. Measure &amp; optimize
</ul>


<p>I'm a strict minimalist. Careful consideration is given to every element placed on a page. If it's unclear how an element is useful, it should be removed. The goal of UI design is clear and simple communication.</p>

<p>What I strive to achieve with my work is elegant simplicity. While print designers have had thousands of years to perfect the usability of ink on paper, interaction designers have had a half-decade at best. HTML is only 21 years old. The web is still very much a free-for-all, with wild UI experimentation going on even in the stablest of properties (Google still reinvents their home page on a regular basis). No one is exactly sure what works best yet, and anyone telling you differently is selling you false confidence.</p>

<p>We do have some tools and useful. A/B testing, funnel metrics&mdash;these are great tools to optimize existing designs. The keyword is existing&mdash;the best you can do is reach a local maxima. Testing 41 shades of blue will get you the perfect blue, but it won't tell you that the entire page should be rebuilt.</p>

<p>A lot of undesigning goes into my work. Developers tend to design for people like themselves. It's a logical decision: programmers and web geeks are rational, analytical, and will send you bug reports (stack trace and all). Who really knows what appeals to twenty-something mothers? They themselves certainly don't.</p>

<p><aside>
  <h2>I do mobile, too.</h2>

</aside></p>

<p>Unfortunately, the vast majority of people do not derive pleasure from tweaking config files and optimizing build times. They're impulsive, emotion-driven, and almost never read any of the copy you write. The computer is a magical black box (or tablet) that was designed to personally frustrate them. How do you design for these people? Simplify.</p>

<p>Interface design is the process of connecting cutting-edge ingenuity with normal people, looking for a stress-free experience.</p>

<h2>The great wide open</h2>

<p>I believe very few designers have the right mindset when designing for the web. Photoshop's arbitrary canvas size does not exist online. The modern browser is a porthole into an infinite canvas that can be beaten and wrought into an uncountable number of combinations.</p>

<p>Eschewing tradition and any trappings of print design, Nylira fully embraces and takes advantage of new media.</p>
