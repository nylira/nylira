  <h1>Profile</h1>

  <section class='markdown'>
    <p>As a developer, you're an incredibly creative individual.</p>

<p>Turning lines of code into living, breathing applications take an immense amount of mental acuity. So much, perhaps, that your visual design abilities have been neglected. That's why you're here.</p>

<p><aside>
  <h2>I've worked with</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>node.js</a>
  <li><a href='//rubyonrails.org'>Rails</a>
  <li><a href='//djangoproject.com'>Django</a>
  <li><a href='//webpy.org'>web.py</a>
  <li><a href='//git-scm.com'>git</a>
  </ul>
</aside></p>

<p><a href='//news.ycombinator.com'>Hacker News</a> is my favorite hangout. I know very well the type of designer I am not: the kind who only knows Photoshop, and hands you PSDs to slice. I cringe at the word 'slice'. I believe it's an astonishing waste of valuable developer time. I've done 'slicing' of my own, and it's both amusing and frustrating how little PSD designers understand about the architecture of the web.</p>

<p>CSS and HTML (or template code) should be provided by your designer. If they care so much about pixel perfection, they should be laying the bricks themselves. And with a better understanding of the limitations of CSS, they gain the ability to bend it to their will. Exceptional designers will flourish under creative restraints. Poor designers shirk away.</p>

<p>Are you looking for someone who cares as much about pixels as you do about code?</p>

<h2>Say hello to your match.</h2>

<p>I'm a visual designer who codes in vi. All my projects are sandboxed into Ubuntu Virtualbox images, which I access through SSH. You might not believe it, but I design entire sites using only the OS X Terminal. This website, in fact, was built using those methods.</p>

<p>These days, I mostly use Photoshop as a glorified color picker.</p>

<p>Whenever possible, I try to avoid writing plain CSS. In a verbose and rendundant-by-design language like CSS, anything that reduces the number of keystrokes required increases productivity. I've taken a liking to <a href="http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/">Stylus</a>, an industrial strength CSS preprocessor. Stylus's powerful mixins and variables allow me to design more with less code, not to mention help stave off the onset of RSI.</p>

<h2>The creative process</h2>

<ul class='process'>
  <li><p>1. Research
  <li><p>2. Draw wireframes
  <li><p>3. Make protypes
  <li><p>4. Test
  <li><p>5. Launch
  <li><p>6. Measure &amp; optimize
</ul>


<p>I'm a strict minimalist. Careful consideration should be given to every element placed on a page. When it's unclear how an element is useful, it should be removed. The goal should be to lessen the cognitive burden on your users, so that they're able to focus their attention on what's actually worthwhile. Good interface design is making these sorts of decisions so the user doesn't have to.</p>

<p>A lot of undesigning goes into my work. Most developers design their apps for people like themselves. Data-fiends and configuration-holics. People who will go through the settings of the app, page-by-page, optimizing the app to their specific use case.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, that doesn't describe the vast majority of humanity. They don't derive satisfaction from tweaking arcane settings: they just want to share their Paris vacation pictures with their friends.</p>

<p>Interface design is the process of bridging that gap in communication.</p>

<h2>The great wide open</h2>

<p>I believe very few designers have the right mindset when designing for the web. Photoshop's arbitrary canvas size does not exist online. The modern browser is a porthole into an infinite canvas that can be beaten and wrought into an uncountable number of combinations.</p>

<p>Eschewing tradition and any trappings of print design, Nylira fully embraces and takes advantage of new media.</p>
