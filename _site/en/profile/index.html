  <h1>Profile</h1>

  <section class='markdown'>
    <p>As a developer, you're an incredibly creative individual.</p>

<p><aside>
  <h2>Not a developer?</h2>
  <p>No worries. I can build you a jaw-dropping site for your online store, erotic photography, or what have you, and you won't have to touch a piece of code. If you're interested, <a href='//nylira.com/en/contact'>get in touch.</a>
</aside></p>

<p>Turning lines of code into living, breathing applications take an immense amount of mental acuity. So much, perhaps, that your visual design abilities have been neglected. That's why you're here.</p>

<p><a href='//news.ycombinator.com'>Hacker News</a> is my favorite hangout. Despite recent angsty complaints about the quality of the site going downhill, it's still the pulsing heart of the web entrepreneur community.</p>

<p>There is a specimen of designer (<em>homo photoshop-usericus</em>) who only knows Photoshop and hands you PSD files to slice. That designer is not me. I believe that slicing PSDs is an astonishing waste of valuable developer time. I've done 'slicing' of my own, and it's disheartening how little PSD designers understand about the fluid architecture of the web.</p>

<p>CSS and HTML (or template code) should be provided by your designer. If they care so much about pixel perfection, they should be laying the bricks themselves. And with a better understanding of the limitations of CSS, they gain the ability to bend it to their will. Exceptional designers will flourish under creative restraints.</p>

<p>Are you looking for someone who cares as much about pixels as you do about code?</p>

<h2>Say hello to your match.</h2>

<p><aside>
  <h2>I've worked along w/</h2>
  <ul>
  <li><a href='//git-scm.com'>git/github</a>
  <li><a href='//nodejs.com'>node.js</a>
  <li><a href='//djangoproject.com'>django</a>
  <li><a href='//rubyonrails.org'>rails</a>
  <li><a href='//webpy.org'>web.py</a>
  </ul>
</aside></p>

<p>I'm a visual designer who codes in vi. All my projects are sandboxed into Ubuntu Virtualbox images, which I access through SSH. I design entire sites using only the OS X Terminal (seriously, this website was built using that exact method).</p>

<p>These days, I mostly use Photoshop as a glorified color picker.</p>

<p>Whenever possible, I try to avoid writing plain CSS. In a verbose and rendundant-by-design language like CSS, anything that reduces the number of keystrokes required increases productivity. I've taken a liking to <a href="http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/">Stylus</a>, an industrial-strength CSS preprocessor. Stylus's powerful mixins and variables allow me to design more with less code, not to mention help stave off the onset of RSI.</p>

<p>At this point, you may be worried about the maintainability of Stylus code. I understand you perfectly. Stylus is not popular outside of the node.js community, and I wouldn't want to be stuck hiring Stylus-only designers in the future, either. Let your concerns be eased. I'm comfortable with Sass as well as Stylus, and both languages compile down to clean CSS3.</p>

<h2>The creative process</h2>

<ul class='process'>
  <li><p>1. Research
  <li><p>2. Draw wireframes
  <li><p>3. Make protoypes
  <li><p>4. Test
  <li><p>5. Launch
  <li><p>6. Measure &amp; optimize
</ul>


<p>I'm a strict minimalist. Careful consideration should be given to every element placed on a page. If it's unclear how an element is useful, it should be removed. The goal of UI design is clear communication.</p>

<p>My goal with my work is to reduce the cognitive burden on your customers, so they can focus their attention on what's important and relevant to them. Leaving too many options open leads to a sub-optimal experience. Depending on your customer's personality, they will either be frustrated or paralyzed by analysis.</p>

<p>A lot of undesigning goes into my work. Most developers tend to design for people like themselves. It's not a bad decision: they're rational, analytical, and will send you bug reports (stack trace and all). Who really knows what appeals to twenty-something mothers? They themselves certainly don't.</p>

<p><aside>
  <h2>I do mobile, too.</h2>

</aside></p>

<p>Unfortunately, the vast majority does not derive pleasure from tweaking config files and optimizing build times. They're impulsive, emotion-driven, and almost never read any of the copy you write. The computer is a magical black box (or tablet) that was designed to personally frustrate them. How do you design for these people? Simplify.</p>

<p>Interface design is the processing of bridging cutting-edge engineering ingenuity with pictures of your grandmother's homemade cookies.</p>

<h2>The great wide open</h2>

<p>I believe very few designers have the right mindset when designing for the web. Photoshop's arbitrary canvas size does not exist online. The modern browser is a porthole into an infinite canvas that can be beaten and wrought into an uncountable number of combinations.</p>

<p>Eschewing tradition and any trappings of print design, Nylira fully embraces and takes advantage of new media.</p>
