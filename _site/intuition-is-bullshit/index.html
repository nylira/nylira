<p>From the <a href='//oed.com'>OED</a>, &#8220;Intuition is the ability to acquire knowledge without inference or the use of reason.&#8221; The <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuition_(knowledge)'>Wikipedia article</a> states that intuition provides us with unjustifiable beliefs (a common ailment of the human brain) and its popularity in supernatural and New Age writings.</p>

<p>With such dubious company, why are user experience engineers using &#8220;intuitive&#8221; to describe the ideal user interface? UX is a science, not an art. There’s no such thing as knowledge without inference or reason. Don’t update your landing page on a whim because it &#8220;feels right&#8221;. Interface changes need to be backed by hard data, not by your gut instincts.</p>

<p>Almost everything your users do can be tracked, recorded, and graphed by numerous <a href='//kissmetrics.com'>data</a> <a href='//google.com/analytics'>dissemination</a> <a href='//mixpanel.com'>services</a>. Don’t let your graphic designer make these decisions for you: start tracking.</p>
