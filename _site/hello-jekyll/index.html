<p>I&#8217;ve migrated this site to <a href='https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll'>Jekyll</a>. It seems much easier to use than ExpressionEngine. Of course, you have to be comfortable in text editors and SSH. I can&#8217;t stand textareas on the web anymore. It feels so slow and unwieldy. Developer notes follow.</p>

<h2 id='blog_summaries'>Blog Summaries</h2>

<p>Why are post summaries so difficult to pull off? I might have to migrate to Nanoc instead. QQ.</p>
