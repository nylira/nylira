I redesigned the Ruby Programming Language homepage. Everything that you see--with the exception of [the logo](http://rubyidentity.org/)--consists of just two text files. Cascading stylesheets have come a long way since 1999. 

My goal for the design was to make a monochromatic & image-less layout look visually striking and pretty. I think I've mostly succeeded.

I have to say that I really love designing with just a text editor. Photoshop is unwieldy, cumbersome and utterly unsuited for most web design work. Sure, it still comes in handy for more illustration-heavy or textured websites. But for the majority of elegant and clean websites, a text editor works better and is magnitudes faster.

Browser notes: this design looks best in Safari/Mac or Firefox 3.6+. I seemed to have broken Chrome's rendering engine with the gradient spammage. If you use IE or Opera, <a href="http://v2.nylira.com/portfolio/ruby">here's a picture</a>.

The <a href="http://ruby-lang.org">current ruby-lang.org</a>, for comparison.
