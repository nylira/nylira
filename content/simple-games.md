I've been interested in game development ever since I was a kid. I've decided to dedicate some of my time in 2014 to game making: here are the results so far.

## Roll a Ball

This game is based on one of the first Unity3D tutorials called "Roll A Ball". I've fleshed it out a bit with custom 3d models, textures, and particle effects.
