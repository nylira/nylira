I made Tetris in JavaScript. It plays well on both PC and mobile browsers. Give it shot in fullscreen [here](http://tetris.nylira.com). Or play the embedded version below.

## High Scores

  Your high scores are persisted through your browser's localStorage. This means that this game is a purely client-side application, and can be played offline without the internet.

## Libraries

  I made great use out of these JS libraries:
  
  * [Combokeys](https://github.com/mightyiam/combokeys) for keyboard shortcuts.
  * [Pixi.js](http://www.pixijs.com/) as my 2D rendering engine.

## Source

  The source code for my Tetris implementation is available on GitHub at [github.com/nylira/tetris](https://github.com/nylira/tetris). Feel free to take a look!
