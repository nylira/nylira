iDoneThis is a web application designed for team management and task accountability. Users receive a daily email asking them what they've done for the day, and management can read them for a sense of the day's progress.  Nylira worked on developing a design for the entire web application, with emphasis on the marketing pages. [Visit client's site.](https://idonethis.com/)
