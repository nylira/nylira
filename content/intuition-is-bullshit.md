From the [OED](//oed.com), "Intuition is the ability to acquire knowledge without inference or the use of reason." The <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuition_(knowledge)'>Wikipedia article</a> states that intuition provides us with unjustifiable beliefs (a common ailment of the human brain) and its popularity in supernatural and New Age writings.

With such dubious company, why are user experience engineers using "intuitive" to describe the ideal user interface? UX is a science, not an art. There’s no such thing as knowledge without inference or reason. Don’t update your landing page on a whim because it "feels right". Interface changes need to be backed by hard data, not by your gut instincts.

Almost everything your users do can be tracked, recorded, and graphed by numerous [data](//kissmetrics.com) [dissemination](//google.com/analytics) [services](//mixpanel.com). Don’t let your graphic designer make these decisions for you: start tracking.
