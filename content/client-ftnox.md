FtNox offers a cryptocurrency exchange as a service to people wishing to start their own Bitcoin, Litecoin, et. al. exchanges. Nylira worked with FtNox to create a customizable user interface for the service. The colors and branding on the site need the ability to be changed by the user while still looking good. *Site currently offline.*
