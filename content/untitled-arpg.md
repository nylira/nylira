I'm developing an Action RPG from scratch using Unreal Engine 4. I switched from Unity due to UE4's source code access and vastly superior performance. Here's the progress so far.

## Maze Generation

First, I worked on implementing the Growing Tree algorithm with Unreal Blueprint. I learned a lot about maze generation algorithms from [Jamis Buck](http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/2/7/maze-generation-algorithm-recap) and [Think Labyrinth](http://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/algrithm.htm).

## Tile Tests

I haven't decided what setting to use for the game yet. I'm experimenting with tile designs to see what looks good from a top-down perspective:
