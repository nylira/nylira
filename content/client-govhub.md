GovHub is a web startup focused on providing a discussion board for individuals interested in U.S. politics. Nylira designed and implemented the front-end for the website. Every page is entirely responsive, working on devices from the original iPhone up to large desktop displays. [Visit demo site.](http://projects.nylira.com/govhub/out)
