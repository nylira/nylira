I've migrated this site to [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). It seems much easier to use than ExpressionEngine. Of course, you have to be comfortable in text editors and SSH. I can't stand textareas on the web anymore. It feels so slow and unwieldy. Developer notes follow.

March 3rd: Why are post summaries so difficult to pull off? I might have to migrate to Nanoc instead. Update: for the meantime, I've decided to not use post summaries.
