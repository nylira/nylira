This site seems simple. But how was it built?

Before I show you the code behind the site, I want to go into the reasoning for building the site the way I have.

I had several objectives in mind while building the new version of this site.

It has to be easily readable on all devices. This means the entire site has to be responsive, and that the homepage must be quick to load.

It has to be as secure as possible. As this is a website for one person, there's no need for me to implement my site in 

It has to be incredibly easy to update. I find that a lot of my ideas for articles and blog posts die before I can publish them online, due to the friction involved in web publishing. I want to keep editing and publishing as simple as possible to reduce that friction. Thus I picked a syntax that is pretty much as close to plain text as possible: Markdown.

The design should be timeless, and a trend-follower.
