As a developer, you're an incredibly creative individual. Turning lines of code into living, breathing applications take an immense amount of mental acuity. So much, perhaps, that your visual design abilities have been neglected. That's why you're here.

I read Hacker News religiously--and possibly too much, for my own good. I know very well the type of designer I am not. The kind who only uses Photoshop and hands you PSDs to slice. I cringe at the word 'slice'. I believe it's incredible waste of developer time. I've done my own 'slicing' of other people's work, and it's laughable how little they understand about how the web works.

CSS and HTML should be provided by your designers. If they care so much about pixel perfection, they should be laying the bricks themselves. And with a better understanding of what HTML can or cannot do, they gain the ability to bend it to their will. Good designers flourish under creative restraints. Bad designers shirk away.

Are you looking for someone who cares as much about pixels as you do about code? 

## Say hello to your match

I'm a visual designer who codes in vi. All my projects are sandboxed into Ubuntu Virtualbox images, which I access through SSH. You might not believe it, but I design entire sites through terminals. This website, in fact, is a static site powered by Jekyll and maintained with Github.

These days, I mostly use Photoshop as a glorified color picker.

## The creative process

I'm a strict minimalist. A lot of thought should be given to every element placed on a page. If it's not clear how it's useful, it should be removed. The cognitive burden you're placing on your users should be eliminated, so they can focus their attention on what's actually worthwhile.

Interface design is not just slapping a skin on your application and calling it a day. It's a process of scrutinizing what your application actually does, and faciliating use scenarios for your customers.

A lot of undesigning goes into my work. Most developers design their apps for themselves, never realizing that the ignorant masses might actually have to use it too. They're not trying to be ignorant though. They've just decided to focus their lives elsewhere, and they find software engineering boring.

## The great wide open

I believe very few designers have the right mindset when designing for the web. The browser is a porthole into an infinite canvas that can be beaten and wrought into an uncountable number of combinations.

Eschewing tradition and any trappings of print design, Nylira fully embraces and takes advantage of new media.
