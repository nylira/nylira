## 1. Not leading with a primary selling point.

## 2. Not proving a clear call to action.

## 3. Forcing the call-to-action without giving the visitor incentive (a free gift, strong benefits) to sign up.

## 4. Overly complicated sign up forms.

## 5. Not providing a (good) mobile site.

## 6. Not being visually memorable.

## 7. Cluttering the page with too much visual noise.

## 8. Not caring about website performance

## 9. Not giving the site visitor a reason to come back to your site.
Even if the site visitor bookmarks your site, chances are very high that they will never visit your site again. Not because they hate you, but because you haven't given them a strong reason to come back. You either need to capture their email or write enough interesting content on a regular basis to keep them coming back.
